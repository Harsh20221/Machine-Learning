###*Importing the dataset
dataset= pd.read_csv('Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv',header=None)##?header is null because we also want to include the first line of the dataset that is why we have written header is eqiual to null
###* Inserting the elements of the dataset into a transactions array 
transactions=[]
for i in range(1,7501):
    transactions.append([str(dataset.values[i,j]) for j in range(1,20)])
###*Preparing the Model for predicdtions  & Doing Predictions 
from apyori import apriori
rules=apriori(transactions=transactions,min_support=0.003,min_confidence=0.2,min_lift=3,min_length=2,max_length=2)  #?transactions will be the list of all the transactions that we created for the model to process
#?We have Calculated our minimum support using the formula that we have 3 transactions everyday and the data we have is for 7 days so we multiply 3 with 7 and divide by total no of transactions that is 7501 , hence our formula will be 3*7/7501
#?In minimum confidence we specify the minimum  percentage  that a  rule   needs to be correct to get included in the calculation 
#?Lift is the Gain in the prediction , means ex---compared to suggesting someone random , how much gain in the accuracy of predictions we got, It Minimum should be 3 
#?Since we are finding out the best deals for buy one product and get another product for free so we will be taking min lift as 2 and max lift  as 2 
#####/ This Rules List will have left -> Right , The left will be the first procuct that the customer has bought and right will be the second product that the cutomser has also bought after buying the first one or we can say those who bought the left product also bought the right product and the confidence parameter in the list will have the percentage values of how correct the prediction is 
###*Organising the Messy rules list into a well organinised Table to display the rules , these rules will determine the chances of a person buying the second productr if he/she has bought the first product 
results=list(rules) ##?Copying the rules to results 
def inspect(results):
    lhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][0])[0] for result in results] ##?THIS [2][0[0]... IS USED TO ACCESS THE CURRECT PARAMETERS FROM THE RESULTS LIST 
    rhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][1])[0] for result in results]
    supports    = [result[1] for result in results]
    confidences = [result[2][0][2] for result in results]
    lifts       = [result[2][0][3] for result in results]
    return list(zip(lhs, rhs, supports, confidences, lifts))
resultsinDataFrame = pd.DataFrame(inspect(results), columns = ['Left Hand Side', 'Right Hand Side', 'Support', 'Confidence', 'Lift'])
###*Sorting all the rules in the table by lift parameter 
resultsinDataFrame.nlargest(n=10,columns='Lift')
print(resultsinDataFrame)#####?THIS WILL DISPLAY THE RESULT --- THE LEFT HAND SIDE WILL HAVE THE PRODUCT THAT THE CUSTOMER FIRST BOUGHT AND RIGHT HAND SIDE WILL HAVE THE PRODUCT THAT CUSTOMER HAS ALSO BOUGHT WHEN HE/SHE HAS BOUGHT THE FIRST PRODUCT , THE CONFIDENCES WILL HAVE THE PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMER FOR EVERY RULE IN point
